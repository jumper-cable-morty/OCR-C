# OCR-C
An alteration of OCR-A by John Sauter, to be better as a font for programming, adding things such as a slahed 0, changed lowercase L, and brackets.

Plans:
1. Expand Glyph Number - this is most important right now.
2. Improve upon already made glyphs to be more programmer friendly
3. Add (contextual) ligatures - hopefully I can find a tutorial 'cause I suck at fontforge.
4. Find someone to help make this font because I'm not good at it as stated earlier.
