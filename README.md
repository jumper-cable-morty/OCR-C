# OCR-C (OCR-Code/OCR-A-Code)
An alteration of OCR-A by John Sauter, to be better as a font for programming, adding things such as a slahed 0, changed lowercase L, and brackets.

**To be clear, this is just a project that I'm starting with only a little knowledge of making fonts. I don't have high hopes for it, but I just thought it might be cool to try since I've always loved OCR-A**

Plans:
1. Expand Glyph Number - this is most important right now.
2. Improve upon already made glyphs to be more programmer friendly.
3. Add (contextual) ligatures - hopefully I can find a tutorial 'cause I suck at fontforge.
4. Find someone to help make this font because I'm not good at it as stated earlier.
